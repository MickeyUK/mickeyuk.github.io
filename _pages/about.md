Hi, I’m Michael, but a lot of folks call me Mickey! I’ve been working as a freelance programmer for over 5 years. I specialize in WordPress development, tinkering behind the scenes on custom plugins and bug fixes. I’m well versed in most of the widely used web technologies and languages, as well as other popular CMS such as Joomla and OpenCart.

I’ve also been branching out in to game development, and have worked on a few small video game productions, as both a programmer and artist. I have experience working with all the industry standard game engines such as Unity, Unreal Engine, GameMaker Studio and CryEngine.
