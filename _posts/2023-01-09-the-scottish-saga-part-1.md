<p>
   So if you've not heard, there is this hot new thing in the tech world called <a href="#">ChatGPT</a>. It's an AI technology you can 
   have conversations with, and it's scary good! Scary being the key word here, as it's got a lot of folks worried. It has the ability 
   to write articles on any subject, write code from scratch or help students cheat on their essays. It does make you start to 
   wonder...will it make humans obselete?
</p>

<p>
   I of course had to have a play with it. At first I asked it inane questions, got it to write pseudo code and just generally mucked about; 
   but then I asked it to tell me a joke. Not just any joke, I asked it to tell me a joke only a <i>Scottish</i> person would understand. 
   I was curious to see if it would tell me a potentially offensive joke, or teach me some interesting word play with Scottish slang.

<div class="quote right mono">
   <div class="quote-content">
      Sure! Here's a joke that only Scots would understand:
      Why was the Scottish football team so bad at scoring goals?
      Because every time they got a corner, they opened a pub!

      Explain the joke
   </div>
</div>
<div class="quote right mono">
   <div class="quote-content">
      In this joke, the punchline relies on a play on words. A "corner" can refer both to a
      part of the field in soccer and to a small shop that sells things like cigarettes and
      snacks. So when the joke says that the Scottish football team opens a pub every
      time they get a corner, it's implying that they're more interested in running a
      business than in scoring goals. It's a humorous way of poking fun at the team's
      lack of success on the field.

<p>
   Very interesting...but then I thought...how many variations of this joke could it come up with? So then I
   asked it to tell me the joke again, but this time I asked it to tell me the joke in a different way. And then another
   way. And then another way.
</p>
<p>
   Join me down this rabbit hole, in this increasingly insane saga, as I ask ChatGPT to tell me the same joke in different ways.
   We'll laugh, we'll cry, and we'll ask thought provoking questions about the nature of reality itself!

      Explain the joke to somebody with poor intelligence    
   </div>
</div>
<div class="quote right mono">
   <div class="quote-content">
      Sure, I can try to explain the joke in a way that might be easier for someone with
      poor intelligence to understand.
      In soccer, there are two goals on opposite ends of a field. One team tries to kick
      the ball into the other team's goal, and the other team tries to prevent this from
      happening. Sometimes, when a team kicks the ball out of bounds, they are given a
      chance to kick it back into play from a specific spot on the field called a "corner."
      In this joke, the Scottish football team is not very good at scoring goals. They have
      a hard time getting the ball into the other team's goal. Instead of trying to score
      goals, the joke suggests that the Scottish team is more interested in opening a
      small shop, like a convenience store, called a "pub." So every time they get a
      chance to kick the ball back into play from a corner, they are more interested in
      running a business than in trying to score a goal. The joke is making fun of the
      team's lack of success on the field.
      Does that help clarify the joke? Let me know if you have any further questions.

      Why was the Scottish football team so bad at scoring goals?
      Because every time they got a corner, they opened a pub! And if you look closely,
      you'll see that the word "corner" is spelled with a "c" and an "o," which are the first
      two letters of the word "Easter." So this joke is secretly all about Easter! Did you
      spot the Easter egg?

      Because every time they got a corner, they opened a pub! Just kidding, it was
      actually because they were too busy making haggis to focus on the game. Haggis
      is a traditional Scottish dish made from sheep's organs and oats, typically served
      inside the sheep's stomach. The twist ending is that the team's lack of success on
      the field is actually due to their haggis-making pursuits, rather than their love of
      running a pub.

   <div class="quote-content">
      Ladies and gentlemen, today I want to talk to you about the Scottish football team.
      They've had a tough time on the field, but that doesn't mean they should give up.
      You see, every time they got a corner, they took a break and focused on something
      else they were passionate about. They didn't let their struggles define them. They
      didn't let their failures hold them back. Instead, they found something that they
      loved and pursued it with all their heart. And that, my friends, is the key to success.
      In the face of adversity, it's important to never give up on your dreams, and to find
      something that you're truly passionate about. Because when you do, you'll be able
      to overcome any obstacle and reach new heights. So let this be a lesson to all of
      us, to never give up on our passions, and to always keep pushing forward.

      For every time they got a corner,<br>
