My website had collected quite a few cobwebs and was looking pretty shoddy, so I decided to tear it all down and redo it all.
I've been itching to give my opinions on new tech, so I wanted to make the site more blog focused.

But why stop there, I thought!? My public GitHub projects could do with a fresh lick of paint too (...and a bunch of issues fixed... ðŸ˜…). So that's what I've been working on!

I'll be jotting down my thoughts, sharing tech news I find interested, sharing progress on my projects and sharing free resources
for creative folk. I hope you'll stick around, comment on my posts and give any feedback (even bad feedback...I can take it!)

I work on an application called [Smash Soda](https://github.com/MickeyUK/Smash-Soda), which makes it easier to host games on
[Parsec](https://github.com/MickeyUK/Smash-Soda). I've built a Discord community around it, feel free to drop in, we're a friendly bunch!

Like Minecraft? Well, I've recently set up a free Minecraft Java Edition server for people to use. It's early days and I'm actually a bit of a Minecraft noob, so it'd be awesome if people wanted to join and help me build it up in to something great.
