## About

This is a modification of <a href="https://github.com/FlavioFS/">Parsec Soda</a>, a tool developed by <a href="https://github.com/FlavioFS/">FlavioFS</a> for improving the hosting experience on Parsec Arcade. It builds upon modifications made by user <a href="https://github.com/v6ooo/">v6000</a>.

The aim of this project is to add additional useful features, with a focus on those who wish to host Super Smash Bros Ultimate.

This is an experimental version of Parsec Soda...expect bugs!

## Features

* ### Smash Bros Ultimate

    Some new admin chat commands have been added for making hosting Smash easier. **!bb** will press everybody's B button twice...good when you're stuck the the match results screen!

* ### Ping Limit

    This allows you to set a latency limit for your lobby. Those whose pings exceed the limit will be kicked automatically.

* ### Moderator System

    Grant moderator permissions to users you trust in your lobbies. This will allow your mods to kick troublesome users and other admin tier commands.

* ### Hotseat

    Hosting a single player game and people aren't sharing nicely? Well now you can set a hotseat timer...when the timer is up, it'll go down the guest list and swap them in to the gamepad 1 slot!


* ### Themes

    Check out the new Midnight theme for Smash Soda or select from some presets!
