Map E-Mail Scraper is a standalone application that uses Google Maps and Hunter.io for collating business contact information.

By default Google search does not show e-mail contact information for establishments, so this tool cross references 
results with Hunter.io to find any associated public e-mail addresses.

Map E-Mail Scraper is a useful tool for people generating leads, and is not intended to be used maliciously. 
Use responsibly folks!
